# LearningChineseApp 
... is (still a sandbox but intended to become) an app for trying out different ways to facilitate the memorizing of chinese words and sentences with the use of Learning Analytics.

## Motivation
Moving to Shanghai and struggling with the language brought up the idea to build my own Learning App. While trying out several ways to learn Mandarin, I continously reflect myself on new, efficent ways to memorize vocabs which I'm going to implement in this app.

## Requrirement Analysis
So far, the app should fullfill these requirements:
- Accessible by mobile devices (mobile WebApp)
- fun-to-use thru _wish-gestures_ (like Tinder)
- focus on connections between words
- user can upload pictures for better memorizing
	- Hypothese: if you see a picture of your own e.g. fork it increases helps you to memorize the chinese word as you will be always remembered while using your fork. 
- no user account necessesary (Learning-Analytic data could be updated in cookie and/or in a quick-and-dirty setup-process)
- Dashboard which shows Learning Progress
- Learning Analytics (Data Model)
-- The app should constantly test different learning approaches to find out which learning/memorizing technique is most efficient for the user. 
- ...

## Build with
- Python 3.x  for Web Scraping the data, i.e. vocabulary
- mySQL and PHP for Database Connection
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org) for the Dashboard
- [Bootstrap 3.4.1](Bootstrap · The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world.https://getbootstrap.com/) for Design
- 
## Contributing
So far, no contributing at this early stage of development.

## How to use it
I deployed the most recent version on [strato](http://www.dirkiboy.com/learningchinese) where you can see a current live version of the app.
If you are more interested in Getting Vocab Data (maybe for your own Learning App) use folder __GettingData__. Beside the final data I use in this app, you will find an iPython Jupyter Notebook
